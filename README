Script that will increase / lower the volume and mute it ( with notification of update )
That script need to be bind on the XF86 key in order to work.

Side note : that will also work if your usb headset got volume control on it

The notification system need libnotify-id from aur to work (  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libnotify-id/ )
